Instead you can easily make all the necessary connections using the provided automated scripts.</p> <p>The key concept to comprehend how force control works and how to use it is the concept of control mode. The control mode represents the current control algorithm that is running on the firmware of the control boards to control a specific joint. For example, the position control modes implements a PID control that tracks the commanded trajectories, while the impedance control realizes a compliant position control by computing the reference torque that an inner torque control loop has to track, given an equilibrium position and the stiffness of a simulated spring. The control mode of a joint can be changed online, during the execution of your application, using the apposite yarp interfaces. In this way you can assign different control modes to different joints in order to obtain the desired behaviour (e.g. you can set some joints in position control mode to obtain a 'stiff' behaviour and other joint in impedance control mode to obtain a compliant behaviour).</p> <p>Five different control modes are currently implemented in the firmware of the control boards:</p>","path":["iCub SW","Force Control on iCub"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_force_control/icub-force-control/#position-control-mode","level":4,"title":"Position control mode","text":"<p>Typical Inputs</p> <p>desired position, trajectory velocity</p> <p>Position control is the standard control mode.

In this case, in fact, the accuracy of position control loop will be poor, because the gravity will act on the low-stiffness joint preventing it to reach the commanded position.

This means that a small drift can be present, due to the fact that the model obtained from the CAD slightly differs from the real iCub (consider the weight of the power cables, the additional skin etc.) If the joint stiffness is zero and <code>gravityCompensator</code> is off, the gravity will make the joint to fall down regardless the commanded position. In this case, running the <code>gravityCompensator</code> is the only way to track to commanded position. Be particular careful in this situation: consider a joint in impedance position control mode, with the gravity compensator turned off and low joint stiffness (e.g 0.01Nm/deg). In this case the position tracking error will be high: for example if you command a position of 30degrees, due to the gravity effect and the very low stiffness, the joint could able to reach only the position at 10 degrees (so the tracking error is 20 degrees). In this condition the impedance control loop is computing a command torque T=0.01*(30-10)=0.2Nm. Now, if you suddenly increase (with a step) the joint stiffness to a high value (for example i.e. 0.6Nm.deg) you obtain a command torque of T=0.5*(30-10)=12Nm which is a huge torque. The joint will move very fast (and joint tendons may be also damaged). In this case the solution is to increase the stiffness gradually, in order to make the position tracking error decrease before setting the joint in high-stiffness mode or turning on the gravity compensator.

For example, typing:</p> <p><pre><code>yarp rpc /icub/head/rpc:i\n</code></pre> followed by: <pre><code>[set] [pos] 0 45\n</code></pre> will command axis 0 of the head (neck_pitch) to 45 degrees. If no motion is seen, it may be necessary to <code>enable</code> the axis: <pre><code> [set] [aen] 0\n</code></pre>  where <code>aen</code> means <code>axis enable</code>. The braces are optional.

In Ethernet robots, a motor control device corresponds to a motor control electronic board that manages from one up to twelve joints.</p> <p>The entry point of motor control device configuration is the file named body_part-ebX-jA_B-mc.xml, that is included in icub_all.xml. This file contains all parameters that the robot's user can modify, for example PID and joints limits, and links other 4 files that only maintainers should modify. These other four files are:</p> <ul> <li>general.xml: contains some flags that change behavior of the device</li> <li>body_part-ebX-jA_B-eln.xml: contains description of electronic board , such as ip address, and specific parameters of communication protocol used by firmware and yarp devices.</li> <li>body_part-ebX-jA_B-mec.xml: contains specific information about mechanics.

In particular, the following files have to be changed:</p> <ul> <li>Update robot <code>yarprobotinterface</code> port prefix.</li> <li>Update interfaces wrapper port prefix.</li> <li>Add port prefix to Whole-Body-Dynamics by adding the following line:   <pre><code>&lt;param name=\"portPrefix\"&gt;/&lt;robot-prefix&gt;/wholebodydynamics&lt;/param&gt;\n</code></pre>   and adding the prefix to external wrench port names, e.g.:   <pre><code>&lt;param name=\"/&lt;robot-prefix&gt;/wholeBodyDynamics/left_leg/cartesianEndEffectorWrench:o\"&gt;(l_foot,l_sole,root_link)&lt;/param&gt;\n</code></pre></li> <li>Update cartesian controllers port prefix.</li> </ul> <p>As a simple test, you can launch <code>yarpmotorgui --robot &lt;robot-prefix&gt;</code> to try to control the robot, and check all the opened ports with <code>yarp name list</code>.</p>","path":["iCub SW","iCub Setup Multiple Robots","Two robots real"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_setup_multiple_robots/two_robots_simulation/","level":1,"title":"Two robots simulation","text":"","path":["iCub SW","iCub Setup Multiple Robots","Two robots simulation"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_setup_multiple_robots/two_robots_simulation/#how-to-use-two-icub-robots-in-gazebo-simulation","level":2,"title":"How to use two iCub robots in gazebo simulation","text":"<p>In order to use icub robot in gazebo simulation environment one needs to have the repository icub-gazebo and have to set GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH to this repository as indicated in the readme file. Furthermore, icub-gazebo-wholebody repository contains complex <code>gazebo models</code> and <code>gazebo worlds</code>, for example icub-standup-world. In general, these two repositories can be used as standalone or they can be used as a part of robotology-superbuild.</p> <p>When an iCub model is spawned in gazebo, all the ports that are opened take the name placed in the gazebo_icub_robotname.ini configuration file as a port prefix. The default name used is <code>icubSim</code>:</p> <p><code>gazeboYarpPluginsRobotName icubSim</code></p> <p>The model name displayed in gazebo is taken <code>iCub</code> from the icub.sdf file and the gazebo-yarp-plugin motor control board ports and ports of the other gazebo-yarp-plugins you placed in your iCub model are opened with the portprefix <code>/icubSim</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are trying to put another iCub model in the simulation, it will fail due to the port conflict as it will try to open another set of robot ports with the same port prefix as <code>/icubSim</code>. So, in order to get around this problem, you have to comment out the line <code>gazeboYarpPluginsRobotName icubSim</code> of gazebo_icub_robotname.ini configuration file.</p> <p>If you are using the two repositories icub-gazebo and icub-gazebo-wholebody as a part of robotology-superbuild you need to build the superbuild and make sure the changes made to gazebo_icub_robotname.ini configuration file are correctly reflected in the <code>install</code> directory.</p> <p>Now, when a first iCub model is spawned in gazebo it takes the default name of <code>iCub</code> and all the ports related to it are prefixed with <code>/iCub</code>. Similarly, an additional iCub model spawned next to it will have the default name <code>iCub_0</code> and all the ports related to this new model are prefixed with <code>/iCub_0</code>. In this way multiple robots can be spawned in gazebo simulation environment without any port conflicts.</p> <p></p> <p>Another important detail concerns the use of <code>wholeBodyDynamics</code>. In general, <code>wholeBodyDynamics</code> is launched with <code>yarprobotinterface</code> with a configuration file like launch-wholebodydynamics.xml that uses <code>/icubSim</code> port prefix as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>So, in order to use multiple icub robots in gazebo you need to have multiple <code>wholebodydynamics.xml</code> configuration files with port prefixes corresponding to the robots spawned in gazebo.</p>","path":["iCub SW","iCub Setup Multiple Robots","Two robots simulation"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_starter_kits/first_steps/","level":1,"title":"iCub First Steps","text":"","path":["iCub Starter Kits","iCub First Steps"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_starter_kits/first_steps/#icub-unpacking-and-installation","level":2,"title":"iCub Unpacking and Installation","text":"","path":["iCub Starter Kits","iCub First Steps"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_starter_kits/first_steps/#1-open-the-box","level":3,"title":"1.

However, the holes for the thumb in the frame are slightly different (see next table). Turn the pulley in order to have the threads already facing (pointing toward) the holes inside the pink frame and the hole inside the pulley itself lying at horizontal. insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both side of the pulley.

Push the two sides of the cable inside the sheath (+) and (-) for each finger. The 2 sides of the cables should get out: For the Thumb: the cables exit from the base of the finger and enter inside two sheaths. For Index &amp; Middle the cables exit at the base of their respective finger. Final cabling: For the Thumb, pass the cables around the pulley as shown. Start with the blue one. Fix the ends of the cables with a knot. Same procedure for the other fingers and make a knot at the end. FINISHED!!! <p>Tip</p> <p>The final cabling is tricky. First, remember to CLOSE the tensioner of each cable before starting the cabling. If you leave the tensioners open, the cabling will not work. For making the final knot, put a mark on the blue cable and knot it. Slowly turn the motor CCW/CW while pulling the red extremity, ensuring that the cable is correctly running on the motor pulley. When the finger is completely closed pull the red cable and put a mark where the knot will be. Proceed by making the knot the closest to the mark.

The internal (refer to cables 1 to 4)or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see the differences?YOU may have guessed on your own but the answer is only that the external one is beneath the 3 proximal motors which makes it more complicated to reach and repair; apart from that it is exactly identical - so to proceed  we will first see how to move the proximal motor, if you need to repair the external wrist motor, and follow up with the explanation of the tendon in a more generical way, as both motors are wired in the same way.If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually beneath them. STEP 2: remove or loose the 2 screws M2.5x8 holding the motor. From now on you can work freely. STEP 3:  remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner.  !!!WARNING!!!  once removed, either you put back the brand new cable inside or else just simply gather the part removed from the tensioner assembly and re-screw it back in until further notice in order to DO NOT LOSE PIECES!!! We can now start wiring!!! STEP 4:  Let's begin with the motor pulley. Take a piece of uncoated cable (more or less 20 cm). Let its extremities be E1 and E2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley. Block the cable on the hole H with some cyanoacrylic glue. STEP 5:  Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit pulleys: the cable should be tangential to the pulleys. Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley. This wiring is identical for the cables E5-E6. STEP 6: Wrist pulley (E3-E7): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E3) and pass it trough the hole H3 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H4. STEP 7: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E7 is identical. STEP 8: Wrist pulley (E4-E8): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E4) and pass it trough the hole H1 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H2. STEP 9: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E8 is identical. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to re-wire every single cable of the wrist you need to insert the tensioners. STEP 10: Pass E3 through the tensioner (LHS1) and tie a knot (KN3). This knot should be positioned taking into account the length of the tensioner. Remove E1 from the tape that blocks it on the motor and pass it trough the tensioner (RHS1). Tie in a knot (KN1) on E1. This knot should be positioned so as to have the tensioner in the middle of the  admissible range of movements. Repeat for cables E2 &amp;E4. STEP 11: Tight the tensioners by screwing in the extremities.","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 1","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V1"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V1/#12-wrist-passive-tendons","level":3,"title":"1.2 Wrist passive tendons","text":"","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 1","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V1"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V1/#121-location-identification","level":4,"title":"1.2.1 Location &amp; identification","text":"<p>From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the Right Wrist and Left Wrist building the passive part of the wrist movements. </p> <p>The pink cable is cable 9 and the red one is cable 10.</p> Left wrist Right wrist","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 1","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V1"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V1/#122-cabling","level":4,"title":"1.2.2 Cabling","text":"<p>Here the sequence you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but use the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations.</p> <p>Which is the length of each cable?

Now it is necessary to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 at the base of the wrist M1.6x4 (blue). Once removed the palm, remove the overall 4 set screws.Use a 0.7mm hexagonal - screwdriver or key. Remove the overall remaining pieces of the broken cable before starting to restore it and inspect inside the cage. Remove every single board above the knuckles - the MAIS board (green) and the fingertips Hall sensors (white). In details: 1. Unplug every single chipset from the main board.!!!TIP: Please write down with a marker the initial of the finger chipset you unplug - it is sometimes messy when remounting everything to find out which chipset is for which finger2. Remove the power connector4. With caution please remove the MAIS Board (by removing its tape) - on the bottom side of the board there is an inductor that sometimes got broken when remove carelessly.  Let's get to business and Let's start wiring! Let's start from the back of the hand. Take a piece of cable (more or less 40cm) and pass it trough the central hole in the pulley (red circle). Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of cyanoacrylic glue into the hole. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes: the cable should enter the holes tangentially. Thus, insert the cable extremities, into the two holes H1 and H2 (red circles). Pass one cable extremity trough the sheath T1 and the other one trough T2. Position the extremities of the sheaths on the sockets of the 2 exit holes in the motor support. Note: the sheath extremity should be inserted correctly in its socket. Focusing on the side of the cable inserted in the sheath T1, pass it through the tensioner and insert the sheath extremity in the tensioner socket. Then, continue the path inserting the cable through the sheath T3 until reaching a hole H3 in the hand frame (blue circle). Finally, insert the cable in the hole and position the extremity of T3 on the socket in correspondence of the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the index finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H7 and exit from H8. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S9.  Tie a knot about 1 cm away from the pulley. Going back to the other cable extremity inserted in the sheath T2, position the extremity of T2 on the socket in correspondence of the hole H4. Finally, insert the cable in the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the pinkie finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H9 and exit from H10. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S10. Twine the cable around the little pulley and then around the pulley at the base of the ring finger.   Pass the cable ending trough the hole H11 and exit from H12. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S11. Pass the cable trough the hole H5 and the sheath T4. Position the extremity of the sheath on the socket of H5. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in its socket.  Pass the cable trough the hole H6 and position the extremity of T4 on the socket of H6. At this point we close the loop, reaching again the first pulley located at the base of the index.  Twine the cable around the pulley and pass the cable ending trough the hole H13 and exit from H14. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S12.  Tie a knot about 1cm away from the pulley. Now unscrew all the screws blocking the cable on the pulleys (S9, S10, S11 and S12). Note that this operation can be done only at a specific configuration of the fingers. At this configuration the screws are accessible thanks to suitable holes on the palm. In the picture you can see the final cable configuration on the first pulley at the base of the Index. The 2 parts of the cabled are represented by different colors. Now tension the cable:  1) Pull the blue cable from its ending. Check that the sheath is inside its sockets at H1 and H3 and block the cable extremity with the screw S9.  2) Pull the red cable from its ending. Check that the sheath is inside its sockets at H4, H5 and H6. Block the cable with the screw S10, S11 and S12. Final test:  Use the head screw from the pulley motor to check if the fingers get opened-closed whenever you turn it CW or CCW. !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!!  Use every unmounting step to put back in place every part of the hand. <p>Tip</p> <p>Tensioning the cable is very important. Even when all the screws are not tight, it may result difficult to tension the cable in all of its parts. This is due to the sharp edges of the pulley which do not allow a uniform distribution of the tension.</p> <p></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>For the Fingers Abduction always start from the index as previously shown.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Each pulley at the base at the fingers has a Pin. If passing trough the holes is complicated, you can remove the finger from the palm. After this operation the pulley can be made more accessible by rotating it around its Pin. In the picture below you can see the pin of the Index pulley.</p> <p></p>","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 1","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V1"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/","level":1,"title":"wrist hand cabling V2","text":"","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#1-wrist","level":2,"title":"1    WRIST","text":"","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#11-wrist-tendons-lengths","level":3,"title":"1.1 Wrist tendons' Lengths","text":"<p>Here is the list of the 10 tendons needed to build the wrist movements.</p>    |Tendon   |IITCODE   |Length   |Alias   | |---|---|---|---| | 1 | 6400 | 72 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_019 | | 2 | 6402 | 84 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_020 | | 3 | 6404 | 101 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_021 | | 4 | 6413 | 124 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_022 | | 5 | 6414 | 107 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_023 | | 6 | 6415 | 113 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_024 | | 7 | 6416 | 112 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_025 | | 8 | 6417 | 107mm | RC_IIT_019_G_026 | | 9 | 6418 | 51 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_027 | | 10 | 6419 | 43 mm | RC_IIT_019_G_028 |","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#12-wrist-motor-tendons","level":3,"title":"1.2 WRIST MOTOR TENDONS","text":"","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#121-location-and-identification","level":4,"title":"1.2.1   Location and Identification","text":"<p>From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the Right Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons.</p> <p>From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the Left Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons.</p>","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#122-cabling","level":4,"title":"1.2.2   Cabling","text":"<p>In the case you found out 1 of the 8 first cables of the wrist broken, here is the sequence you need to follow to restore it.</p> Pictures step by step guide FIRST THING FIRST: Which side of the wrist is broken?The internal (refers to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see some visual differences?YOU may have guessed on your own, but the answer is only that the external motor is beneath the 3 proximal motors, which makes it more complicated to reach and repair.  Apart from that, it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motors and follow up with the explanation of the tendon repair in a more generical way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: Remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. STEP 2: Remove the 2 screws M2.5x10 holding the motor.From now on, you can work freely. STEP 3: Remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner.  !!!WARNING!!! It is the utmost importance that youDO NOT MIX the 3 parts of the tensioner.ALWAYS KEEP THEM TOGETHER the main part and its 2 screwing side  STEP 4: At the level of the wrist pulley, just remove the broken cable and replace it : EASY for cable 5 and 6BUT LESS EASY for cable 1 and 2, because you need to remove the mechanical part preventing you from inserting and removing the head crimp. To do so, just remove the 2 screws M2x6 and slide the block to retrieve and replace the head crimp.Once done, put back on place the block and the 2 screws. We can now start wiring!!! STEP 5:Let's begin with the motor pulley, here is the way to wire them both (as they are perfectly identical). LEFT ARMThe BLUE cables for the Left Forearm are:  4 and 7The RED cables for the Left Forearm are: 3 and 8 RIGHT ARMThe BLUE cables for the Right Forearm are:3 and 8The RED cables for the Right Forearm are:4 and 7 STEP 6: Put a 2 tie wraps one for each side (or cable) in order to prevent them from getting untwisted. picture motor almost closed on support STEP 7:Put back in place the motor with its 2 screws M2.5x10. Leave 1mm in between the motor and the support. We will cover this aspect later. STEP 8:Let's wire the wrist pulleys (either for 1,2 or 5,6)Here is the detailed wiring for the left arm, please mirror it for the right arm.The wiring is quite simple. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to rewire every single one of the wrist cables you need to insert the tensioners. Let's make the example of the 4 cables 1 to 4. STEP 9:Remove the tie wrap at the level of the motor wrist,for let's say cable 3. Open one side of the tensioner and start putting the ring, then the threaded pieceof the tensioner, finish by screwing the ring onto the threaded piece. Do the exact same for the cable 1. STEP 10:Screw both pieces into the main tensioner part - Let's say just 2 threads on both sides, just to make it hold until we tense it. STEP 11:Repeat STEP 9 and STEP 10 with cables 2 and 4. STEP 12:Use 2 pliers to hold on the tips of the threaded pieces' tensioner and use with any toolfitting the hole inside the main part of the tensioner AND finally screw them.!!! TIP !!!depending on how you are facing the cablesjust screw CW or CCW for half a turn tounderstand if the 2 threaded pieces are going inside the main piece or if they get out - THEY NEED TO GET IN OBVIOUSLY. Repeat the above step on both tensioners until you get a quite nice tensing (but not super tense, this will be done right next). FINAL STEP:Tense the 2 screws that we left a bit opened on STEP 7.","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#13-wrist-passive-tendons","level":3,"title":"1.3 WRIST - PASSIVE TENDONS","text":"","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#131-location-and-identification","level":4,"title":"1.3.1   Location and Identification","text":"<p>From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the Right Wrist and Left Wrist building the passive part of the wrist movements.</p> RIGHT WRIST LEFT WRIST","path":["iCub HW","iCub","The iCub Tendons manual","Lower Arm","Version 2","Repair Phase","wrist hand cabling V2"],"tags":[]},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V2/#132-cabling","level":4,"title":"1.3.2   Cabling","text":"<p>Here the sequence  you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but use the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations.</p> Pictures step by step procedure !!!KEEP IN MIND!!!whenever you need to replace one of the 2 cablesyou FIRST need to release the tensioners .

STEP 7a:PINKIE FINGER1. you need to untighten ENTIRELY the axes screws on both sides of the finger (on the palm side it can be removed - pay attention that the ball bearing may fall as well,  just remember to replace it when remounting -  BUT REFRAIN TO REMOVE on top side - or else you will lose the center of the finger) 2. try to move the pulley along its pin until you succeed to insert the cable into it.3. Put back on the axes screws and retighten them. STEP 7b:RING FINGERSame 3 first steps as the Pinkie finger.4. Finally insert the cable into the hole leading to T4. STEP 8: Before starting to wire the base of the index fingerit is really important to block the cable at the base of the pinkie finger - in this way we wont unintentionally untwine the wiringat the level of the motor pulley.1. Insert the set-screw onto the pinkie finger and tighten it.. Let's start wiring the index base pulley STEP 9:As for pinkie and ring fingers: 1. untighten the 2 axes screws in order to be able to move the pink (color) pulley sideways around its PIN2. Pass the cable coming from T4 (red) inside the pulley hole. STEP 10:1. wire the cable from T0 (blue)2. re-center the pinky pulley3. put the axes screw back on.

In this way, the motor controller engine can check that the joint moves inside the rotor limits specified in the mechanical configuration file avoiding dangerous situations like winding to much cable and pushing against the hardware limit.</p> <code>Calibration type</code> 6 <code>calibration1</code> not used <code>calibration2</code> velocity expressed in iCubDegree/s <code>calibration3</code> 1 if distal joint, -1 if proximal joint.

Moreover, it calibrates the motor incremental encoder moving the joint toward a target position in a way specified by the parameter <code>calibration3</code>. If it is <code>-1</code>, then the joint moves to the position written in <code>calibration4</code>, otherwise the joint moves to <code>calibration5</code>.</p> <p>Calibration 6 FAP, instead, does not calculate either the joint encoder factor or the offset of the 0.0 position because the calibration of the FAP absolute encoder is performed manually. Therefore, the fingers are manually moved by checking the raw values and then the <code>offset</code>, the <code>rotation</code>, and the <code>invertDirection</code> parameters are specified in the POS service configuration file, in order to have the fingers rotation comprised in the range [~0, ~90] deg, in the desired direction. When the FAP is calibrated and works properly (the procedure described above shall be done just once, after the hand is mounted), the calibration 6 procedure can start. The steps are the same as those in <code>calibration6 mais</code>. Therefore, the motor encoder gets calibrated by moving the joint to the target position depending on the value of <code>calibration3</code> parameter: if it is <code>-1</code>, then the joint moves to the position written in <code>calibration4</code>, otherwise the position expressed in <code>calibration5</code> is used as target. Thereby, the rationale of this procedure is to find the zero as well as the offset of the motor incremental encoder. The movement is performed using the velocity specified in <code>calibration2</code> parameter. If the joint reaches the target position then the calibration ends successfully.</p>","path":["iCub SW","Calibration Types","Standard Calibration Types"],"tags":[]},{"location":"robot_calibration_types/standard_calibration_types/#calibration-7","level":3,"title":"Calibration 7","text":"<p>This calibration is used for joint with absolute analog sensor.

First, set to <code>true</code> the boolean variables <code>skipCalibration</code> and <code>useRawEncoderData</code> in the file <code>general.xml</code>. This is meant to disable calibration at <code>yarprobotinterface</code> startup. Also, this will make the port <code>/ergocub/left_arm/state:o</code> print the raw values (i.e., uncalibrated) for the finger joint encoders.  Once done, you should check the values printed out by the port running in a terminal the command:</p> <pre><code>yarp read ... /ergocub/left_arm/state:o\n</code></pre> <p>and by doing this you can observe which should be the raw value of the offset for the encoder joint when the finger is at the hard-stop position (ideally finger full open). Thus, you should set this value (with the same sign of the value printed by the port) as the value for the parameter <code>calibration5</code>. After that, by observing how the values printed out by the port change, you would check if the <code>invert direction</code>, i.e. <code>calibration3</code> value, should be <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> and if a specific value of rotation should be added at <code>calibration4</code> in order to prevent the encoder from crossing the zero while finger joint is moving.</p> <code>Calibration type</code> 14 <code>calibration1</code> PWM used to move to hard-stop limit <code>calibration2</code> Final position (in iCubDegrees) at the hard-stop limit [motor zero] <code>calibration3</code> Invert direction boolean parameter <code>calibration4</code> Rotation (in iCubDegrees) parameter <code>calibration5</code> Offset (in iCubDegrees) parameter <code>calibrationZero</code> 0.0 (only value corrected) <code>calibrationDelta</code> defined by user expressed in degree <p>Note</p> <p>The <code>calibration14</code> rotation parameter cannot assume any value. Allowed values are: <code>0</code>, <code>32768</code>, <code>16384</code>, <code>-16384</code>, expressed in <code>iCubDegrees</code> as specified in the table above. Specifically, these values correspond to the following numbers in degrees: <code>0</code>, <code>180</code>, <code>90</code>, <code>-90</code>. Notice how these values are only accepted without decimals; therefore, only integer parts are checked. In fact, multiplying the degrees by the conversion factor, defined in the Legend section, generates outputs with decimals. Thus, it has been decided to round them up.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Considering that this calibration works in close relation with absolute encoders, it is necessary to keep in mind the following note.   First, <code>calibration type 14</code> has been designed to work with finger joints and specifically it is currently tested on joints that use <code>FAP</code> encoders. However, it should work similarly with other types of absolute encoders. In particular, the parameters that should be modified are <code>calibration3</code>, <code>calibration4</code>, and <code>calibration5</code>.   Another detail to cite is also related to the aforementioned <code>FAP</code> parameters. Specifically, it has been chosen to pass those data in <code>iCubDegree</code>, but it is known that <code>POS</code> service, which manages the <code>FAP</code> encoder, use different datatype, especially for the rotation parameter that is defined by an <code>enum type</code>. Therefore, in the firmware, this conversion is managed.    In this manner, during the calibration phase, the absolute encoder is calibrated first, by setting the <code>offset</code> and adjusting it using <code>invertdirection</code> and <code>rotation</code> if different than zero.    Then, the algorithm moves the incremental encoder at the motor to the <code>hard limit</code> (at open or closed finger based on the PWM sign) at setting <code>calibration2</code> as the <code>motor zero</code>.    After that, <code>rotorPosMin</code>, and <code>rotorPosMax</code> passed in the mechanical configuration file, are set as the rotor limits. Thus, the motor will move only between those limits (expressed in degrees at motor).</p>","path":["iCub SW","Calibration Types","Standard Calibration Types"],"tags":[]},{"location":"robot_calibration_types/standard_calibration_types/#legend","level":2,"title":"Legend","text":"<ul> <li><code>iCubDegree</code>: the firmware uses iCubDegree instead of degree in order to use more resolution.</li> </ul> <p>Info</p> <p>1 Degree = 182.044 iCubDegree, where 182.044 is 65535/360; The value 182.044 is contained in the parameter “Encoder” of mechanical configuration files of each robot.</p> <ul> <li><code>Encoder conversion</code> factor: is the factor used by firmware to convert the value read from encoder to iCubDegree.</li> </ul>","path":["iCub SW","Calibration Types","Standard Calibration Types"],"tags":[]},{"location":"robot_power/robot_power_button/","level":1,"title":"Power push buttons","text":"<p>The power push buttons on the iCub 2.5 backpack and on the iCub3 back have different meaning depending on their colors.

The iCub software includes both the software that runs inside the iCub robot and in the machines that are part of the iCub setup, and the software that can be installed on external machines to simulate or communicate with the iCub robot. The majority of the base iCub software is written in the C++ programming language.</p> <p>As of 2020, the most common way of consuming the iCub software is by compiling it from source code. There are two possible methods to compile the iCub software from source code. The first one (\"superbuild\") is to install the software via the <code>robotology-superbuild</code>, a distribution of software mantained at IIT and other related software. The second one (\"manual\") is to manually install each software package required for iCub software on its own. The recommended way to consume iCub software for users that are not part of the iCub development is to stick to released versions of the iCub software, in particular to the distributions of software released every three months, as described in Software Distros. Documentation for compiling the iCub software from source are available in the Installation from sources menu section.</p> <p>Depending on the operating system you want to use, it may be available also the possibilities of installing the iCub software via pre-compiled binaries instead of manually compiling the source code. Documentation for this workflow is available in the Installation from pre-compiled binaries menu section.</p> <p>Regardless of how you installed your software, you can check if it has been installed correctly by following the instructions in the Check your installation page.</p> <p>The standard installation procedure is appropriate for normal developers system, but some machines on the iCub setup, in particular the <code>icub-head</code> system that is installed in the head of the iCub robot, requires specific software installation instructions.

Anyways, if you are interested in the specific insight regarding the conversion you can check this repository, which has been mainly used for two scopes:</p> <ul> <li>to check the validity of the linearization done and understand the magnitude of the error inside the working conditions, which are typically between 20 and 80 ℃.</li> <li>to evaluate the exact raw values needed for setting the defined error values to be used in the firmware, so that we can have an accurate conversion (related to our formula) on the high level. (See error values for more details).</li> </ul>","path":["iCub SW","Sensing","Motor Temperature Sensors","Reading data"],"tags":[]},{"location":"temperature_sensors/software/reading_data/#data-conversion-from-raw-value-to-celsius-degree-value","level":3,"title":"Data conversion from raw value to Celsius degree value","text":"<p>For converting a value from raw to Celsius degree the following steps are applied:</p> <pre><code>Evaluate a first temporary value:\n\n    double tmp = temperature * ((_resolution_pga) / (_pga_gain * _vcc * (_resolution_tdb + 1)));\n\nwhere:\n- _resolution_pga: resolution of the Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) mounted on the ADC, which is set to 2.048 [V]\n- _resolution_tdb: resolution of the TDB ADC, which is set to 32767 since we are working at 16bit and we are saving the value to a signed int\n- _vcc: incoming voltage in the voltage divider, which for us is set to 5V\n- _pga_gain: gain for the PGA, which we have set to 2\n\nThe use the calculated temporary value for evaluate the denominator of the final operation:\n\n    double den = _ptc_gradient * (_r_2 - _r_2*tmp - _r_3*tmp);\n\nwhere:\n- _ptc_gradient: slope of the PTXXX line\n- _r_2: one of the two upper resistors in the voltage divider bridge, which for us is equal to 4700 [Ohm]\n- _r_3: lower resistor of the bridge, which it should be set equal to the value, in Ohm, of the PTXXX at zero degree.
