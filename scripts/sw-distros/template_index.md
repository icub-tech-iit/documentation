Software Distros
===

## 🚀 Software Distros Workflow
- 📅 SW Distros are delivered on a **time-based workflow**.
- 4️⃣ SW Distros are released along with **binaries** at the following quarters: **Feb, May, Aug, Nov**.
- 🆓 The feature-freeze lasts **one month**.
- 📛 Naming convention adheres therefore to **YYYY.MM**: e.g. 2020.02, 2020.05...
- 📝 Repositories stay on their usual release convention in order to enable proper **semantic versioning**. To link repos tags to SW Distro and run CI, we rely on the infrastructure provided in [`robotology/robotology-superbuild`](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild).
- 📦 Exceptionally, we may deliver **feature-based releases** (only tags/branches, no binaries) as **YYYY.MM.feat-nn**.
- 🐞 **Patches** are coded as **YYYY.MM.patch-nn** and, like the feature-based releases, are shipped only in terms of tags/branches.
- 📢 We make **announcements** of the distros and their content on a dedicated channel of [Robotology Community](https://github.com/robotology/community/discussions/categories/releases).

## Software Versioning Table
The table hereinafter reports on the versions of the packages (specified in terms of Git tags/branches/commits)
