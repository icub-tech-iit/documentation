# ‚òÅ Cloud Workflow
You can leverage on the following Cloud IDE's to quickly get a testing platform where to try out how the documentation is rendered.

## üîò [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io)
First off, sign up for Gitpod using your GitHub credentials. You'll have 50 hours/month of free usage on public and private repositories. Also, remember to visit the [Gitpod Integrations](https://gitpod.io/integrations) to make sure that all GitHub permissions are ticked in.

Then, install the [Gitpod browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension).

## üîò [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) on Forks
> [!Warning]
When forking the repository, remember to copy out all the branches. Then, work on the default branch.

Follow the steps below where you have to correctly fill up the signature `your-fork`:
- Browse to https://github.com/your-fork/documentation/actions and enable the actions if they got disabled.
- Browse to https://github.com/your-fork/documentation/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml and click on the <kbd>Run workflow</kbd> button.
- Browse to https://github.com/your-fork/documentation/settings/pages, select the `gh-pages` branch and wait until the GitHub Pages link becomes green to click on!

# üîΩ Local Workflow

## üíª Install the environment yourself
If you prefer to work on the documentation on your own computer without using Cloud IDEs as described in the previous section,
you need to install [**`mkdocs`**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) first.

Once installed, just clone this repo, navigate to it and install the required dependencies:
```console
git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/documentation.git
cd documentation
pip install $(mkdocs get-deps)
```

Finally, serve the content:
```console
mkdocs serve
```

## üì¶ Rely on package managers
In the next sections, we will describe in detail how to install the required dependencies using different package managers.

### üêç conda
You can use the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) distribution to install the required dependencies on Linux, macOS or Windows.
First of all you need a conda distribution, for example [Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

If you already have a conda distribution, just create a new [environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) (for example called `mkdocs-env`) and install in it the require dependencies:
```console
git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/documentation.git
cd documentation
conda create -n mkdocs-env
conda activate mkdocs-env
conda install --channel conda-forge mkdocs
conda install --channel conda-forge $(mkdocs get-deps)
```

After the installation, whenever you need to test the website just activate the `mkdocs-env` environment and call `mkdocs serve` in the `documentation` directory:
```console
cd documentation
conda activate mkdocs-env
mkdocs serve
```
