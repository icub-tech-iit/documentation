iCub Tech Docs
==============

üåê Browse our [online documentation](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation).

‚ö† This is an attempt to make available to the community useful information that are not present or easily accessible through our [official documentation](http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Main_Page). Thus, at the time being, it is intendend to be an ever-growing container that supports and integrates with the official resources.

üìù Importantly, you can contribute to these docs by fixing typos and proposing new additions (see below). 

## Contributing
Check out our [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## ‚òÅ Cloud IDE
You can leverage on the following Cloud IDE's to quickly get a testing platform where to try out how the documentation is rendered.

### [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) 
First off, sign up for Gitpod using your GitHub credentials. You'll have 50 hours/month of free usage on public repositories.

Then, install the [Gitpod browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension).

## Local Workflow

If you prefer to work on the documentation on your own computer without using Cloud IDEs as described in the previous section, 
you need to install the following software packages: 
* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
* [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)
* [mkdocs-material-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-material-extensions/)
* [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/)

Once you have installed them, just clone this repo, navigate to it and serve its content with the `mkdocs serve` command:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/documentation
cd documentation
mkdocs serve
~~~

In the next sections it will be described in detail how to install the required dependencies using different package managers.

### conda
You can use the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) distribution to install the required dependencies on Linux, macOS or Windows.
First of all you need a conda distribution, for example [Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

If you already have a conda distribution, just create a new [environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) (for example called `mkdocs-env`) and install in it the require dependencies:
~~~
conda create -n mkdocs-env
conda activate mkdocs-env
conda install --channel conda-forge mkdocs-material mkdocs-material-extensions pymdown-extensions
~~~

After the installation, whenever you need to test the website just activate the `mkdocs-env` environment and call `mkdocs serve` in the `documentation` directory:
~~~
cd documentation
conda activate mkdocs-env
mkdocs serve
~~~
