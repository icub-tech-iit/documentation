| iCub version | Features | Notes | 
| :--:  | :--| :--| 
| v1.0	 | This version was distributed during the RobotCub open call. It has the following features: <p> 1. Only the upper arms are covered. <br> 2. No force sensors available. <br> 3. No touch sensors available. </p> | | 
| v1.1   |	Main features are: <p> 1. Sensorized hand joints (MAIS boards are mounted on the back of the hand). <br> 2. Six axes force sensors at each limb. This allows impedance/compliance control as described here.<br> 3. Fully covered (upper arm, forearm, torso, hip, legs). | |
| v1.1.1 | This is an intermediate version. The only difference with the previous is that the main control board has changed from eCAN (or CFW1) to CFW2 | |
| v1.2   | This version has tactile sensors. Main features are: <p> 1. Sensorized palm.<br> 2. Sensorized fingertips </p>| |
| v1.3   | This version has tactile sensors added on the forearms. | |
| v1.4   | This version has tactile sensors added on the upper arm and chest. | |
| v1.7   | This version is characterized by a slight difference in the [kinematics of the wrist](../icub_kinematics/icub-forward-kinematics/icub-forward-kinematics-arms.md). | |
| v2.0   | This version has: <p> 1. Incremental encoders (optical) directly mounted on the motors (fast side of the reduction gear). <br> 2. Completely redesigned fore-arm and hands assemblies. <br> Completely redesigned head assembly for higher performances (stronger neck motors, zero-backlash eye movement) <br> 3. Mounts complete set of sensitive skin.
| v2.3   | This version is a v2.0 + talking-Head (it's now obsolete, head with motors for lips and jaw) | |
| v2.5   | This version has: <p>  1. Hands v2.0 <br> 2. Stronger legs (with the possibility to mount series elastic elements on the knee and on the ankle) <br>   | 
| v2.5.5 | This version is a v2.5 + a backpack for batteries | | 
| v2.6   | v2.5.5 with new face expression (RFE master board) | |
| v2.7   | v2.6 with high-performance IMU on the waist | |
| v2.8   | v2.7 with beam-splitter in the eye for hosting event driven and frame based sensors | |
| v2.9   | _obsolete_ | |   
| v2.10  | **v2.7** with the 4K FRAMOS-IMX145 cameras, NVidia Orin NX [(UKIT009)](../upgrade_kits/head_4k/support.md) and intel i7 11th on com express type 10 module in the backpack | |
