# Which version do I need?
This question is quite common whenever the number of versions and revisions start to become... more than one.
The Debian image to use depends on the iCub version:
- iCub up to version 1.1 ***must*** use a Etch and a Half distribution (image version 1.x). Persistent filesystem allows deep system configuration; if you are happy with the current configuration you can skip this update, while if you really need to change system configuration now you can by applying this update.
- iCub from version 1.2 on can use the latest version: we kindly recommend you to keep Debian system updated to the last version (at the time of writing it means the 9.x @ November 2020). For persistent filesystem this configuration can be changed without re-burning a new image, you can just edit the configuration files of the network as you would normally do with Linux system.

# Burn the Debian image version 7.x (latest)
Starting from version 6.0 images come in a compressed archive file containing the USB image to write to an USB memory.

## Where to download the ZIP archive
Compressed archives can be downloaded [here](http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/downloads/pc104-images/)

## How to create the bootable USB drive with the live image

1.  Download the latest image from the [above link](http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/downloads/pc104-images/)
2.  Extract the image
3.  Take an USB-2 drive at least of 16 GB size (please note that using an USB3 disk or a huge disk, eg. 32 GB, may not work depending on the version of your PC104)
4. burn the image file (it has the .img extension), you can use the follwing tools:

### Windows
Please use [Win32 Disk Imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)

### Linux (command line)
Linux users can  use the dd command to directly write an IMG file’s contents to a removable media device. Insert the removable media and run the following command on Ubuntu:

`sudo dd if=/home/user/icub-live_7.10-201126_rt-amd64.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M`

Replace `/home/user/icub-live_7.10-201126_rt-amd64.img` with the correct name of USB image and `/dev/sdX` with the path to your USB or SD card device. **Be very careful to specify the correct disk path here — if you specify the path to your system drive instead, you’ll write the contents of the image to your operating system drive and corrupt it**

### Linux (GUI tool)
There is a GUI available in Ubuntu, called _"Disks"_ (gnome-disks) and comes default in later Ubuntu: connect the USB drive and just right-click on the image file and select _"Open with Disk Image Writer"_, then select the drive USB drive you just inserted.

## Burn the Debian image version 5.x (old)

From version 5.0 on, the image is based on a Debian LIVE system. Version 5.x images come into a standard ISO Hybrid image file and there is a script to write the image to a USB memory

### Where to download the ISO image and burn script

ISO images and the script can be downloaded [here](http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/downloads/pc104-images/) Some images are compressed, if so uncompress it before proceeding. To verify the file has been successfully downloaded, the md5 code can be verified by placing the .md5 file in the same folder as the uncompressed image and typing the following command:

`md5sum --check MD5FILE.md5`

### How to put the iso on a USB memory

Please use the icub_iso2usb.sh script: this script will create a working bootable USB from the ISO file and ensure compatibility on some old PC104.
This scripts will also enable file persistence (see below).
**NOTE : this script is compatible ONLY with Debian GNU/Linux 7 wheezy and Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Trusty**

### What is file persistence and how to use it

File persistence is used to write the changes you made to the live filesystem (i.e. if you modify a file or write a new one) to a separate partition on the USB memory, allowing those changes to survive a reboot.
The bigger is the USB memory, the more space you have for the new files, so we suggest at least a 4 Gb USB memory. If you mount an USB memory which persistence enable on a normal PC, you will see two partitions:

-   LIVE partition, which contains the live image files
-   PERSITENCE partition, which contains all the modified or new files

### How to use the icub_iso2usb.sh script

This script takes a iCub PC104 live image and write it to an USB memory,
optionally enabling file persistence. The script run on a Linux system and requires the following commands to be installed:

-   parted
-   mkdiskimage
-   mkdosfs
-   mkfs.ext4
-   install-mbr
-   syslinux
-   p7zip

On a Debian 7 system, this means that you must install the following packages

`parted syslinux syslinux-common syslinux-utils dosfstools e2fsprogs p7zip mbr`

The script usage is the following

`icub_iso2usb.sh -f LIVE_ISO_FILE -t USB_TARGET_DEVICE [-p PERSISTENCE_SIZE]`

where:

-   **LIVE_ISO_FILE** is the live filename (mandatory parameter)
-   **USB_TARGET_DEVICE** is the device to write to the iso image -     *important: USE a device not a partition* (mandatory parameter)
-   **PERSISTENCE_SIZE** is the size of overlay partition (in MB) - set to 0 to disable overlay, the default persistence size is 1024 MB

Example:

` icub_iso2usb.sh -f icub-live_4.0-14.11.12-rt-amd64.iso -t sdc`

There is also an inline help for the script, available with

`icub_icub2usb.sh -h`

The image requires an amount of space which is bigger than the the ISO size of a 10%, so setup the persistence partition size accordingly. The script checks if the target USB memory has enough space for live system and persistence (if not disabled), so don't worry.

# Required customizations

## Set RobotName variable

Edit the file:

`/home/icub/.bashrc_iCub`

replace the line:

`export YARP_ROBOT_NAME=myiCubRobotName00`

with the name of your robot e.g. iCubGenova01

## clean the CMakeCache before compiling

When upgrading the usb key to a different version, remember to clean the CMakeCache before compiling!! This is because some path are likely to be changed in the meanwhile

## SSH passwordless login

User authentication credentials are stored inside the `/home/icub/.ssh/authorized_key` file; each line in this file is related to a different entry user\@host. User credentials can be added also by using this command for each user\@machine you want to log from :

`ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub icub@pc104`

## Startup scripts

**Important**: these instructions apply to the recent *persistent* images of the Linux (starting from 1.7 and 3.0).

There are some scripts that customize the Linux when the pc104 boots up; those scripts are inside /etc/rciCub.d folder. Normally, you don\'t need to modify them, but be aware of them.

## Other Customizations

The persistent version of the Debian distribution is now writable so any
customization can be done. Please be aware of what you do, because any
changes in configuration file can lead to malfunction.

# Common Problems and how to solve them

## I used an USB3 and/or 32 GB disk and the system does not boot

Try with a USB2 smaller ( 16GB or better 8 GB) drive. Some PC104 have problems in reading those recent USB drives.

## The `icub_iso2usb.sh` script asks me _"The closest location we can manage is.. Is this still acceptable to you?"_

Simply press "Y" and forget about the warning _"Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab."_ :)

## Once I created a new USB memory with the PC104 image, ssh complains that _"Remote host identification has changed"_ and does not connect to the PC104

This is normal: for security reasons when a new iCub live is executed for the first time, a new SSH Key is created for the PC104 host. Please remove all the entries in the file

`~/.ssh/known_hosts`

that refers to pc104 or 10.0.0.2 and login again.

This must be done from each machine you want to connect to the PC104.

*See also [this link](http://askubuntu.com/questions/9800/remote-host-identification-has-changed-warning-when-connecting-over-ssh)*

## I used the live USB first on a computer, then when I plugged it into the PC104 it does not work anymore

Probably the PC104 booted correctly, but the network is not reachable (you can check it by [connecting a vga cable to the PC104](https://svn.robotology.eu/repos/iCubHardware-pub/trunk/mechanics/public/doc/howTo/Connect_VGA_to_PC104.pd)
inside iCub's head)

Live systems write some info about the network card the first time they boot on a machine. This implies that if you boot the live on a desktop and then you plug it to a different machine the network may not work (since the network card is different).

To fix this you have two options:

1. **quick and dirty** - on the live USB, open the file `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-presisten-net.rules` and remove any pair of lines like the following:
```
# PCI device 0x8086:0x10f5 (e1000e)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:1f:16:0b:47:4d", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
```
(of course attributes like *address*, *name* or *device* may not exactly the same in your file)

2. **clean and easy** - burn another USB and FIRST install it on the PC104
