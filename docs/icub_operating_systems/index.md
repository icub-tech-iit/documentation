# Introduction

This manual describes how to install and customize the linux operating systems required to run on machines in the iCub enviroment.

## Robot OS

There are two versions of the customized OS that runs on the machine inside iCub head:

- [_The iCub LIVE for PC104_](./pc104/icub-live.md) - based on Debian LIVE environment, it is for old iCub version with a PC104 board (without onboard Hard Drive) and it is distribuited usign a pre-built image.
- [_The iCub OS_](./icubos/icubos.md) - based on Ubuntu Server, it is for latest iCub versions with a COM-Express board (with onboard Hard Drive) and can be installed starting from a pre-built image or we provide instructions to install and custommize a standard Ubuntu server installation.

## Other machines

[_Here_](./other-machines/generic-machine.md) you can find instruction needed to custommize a generic machine, such as a laptop or a desktop, making all the changes required to add it to the iCub enviroment, starting from a default Ubuntu or Debian installation.

Once you customized your machine, you can proceed with further setup for special machines, such as:

- [_CUDA workstation_](./other-machines/cuda-workstation.md)
- [_The iCub Server (Workstation)_](./other-machines/icub-server-from-scratch.md)
- [_The iCub Server (laptop)_](./other-machines/icub-server-laptop.md)
