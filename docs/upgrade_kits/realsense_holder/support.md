## Historical review
This upgrade kit has been developed together with the [HSP@IIT](https://www.iit.it/web/humanoid-sensing-and-perception) research line as an optional plug-in support to improve iCub perception and facilitate it in grasping tasks iCub. For reference, see also the page [design holder realsense](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/design-holder-realsense).
