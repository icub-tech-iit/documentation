## Historical review:
This upgrade kit has been developed together DIC team as an optional plug-in support to improve iCub perception and facilitate it in grasping tasks iCub. For reference, see also the page [design holder realsense](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/design-holder-realsense).
The holder has been designed to be compatible with the two following RealSense models:

|     Alias        |  Description       |  Cod. Wgst |

## Assembly instruction.

First of all, it must be said that the electronic part of the upper arm covers is already supplied, that is, the MTB4 cards and the hexagon shape (skin) are mounted, glued and connected together.
Before starting assembly, check the orientation of the covers.<br>
