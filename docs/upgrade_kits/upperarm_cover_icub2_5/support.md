## Historical review:
Before, in the previous Revision of the covers, the mini cards were organized informing of the hexagon. This largely caused the skin patch PCB to flex and break, because they took the accentuated curvature of the cover (see image).

To solve this problem, we reduced the number of PCBs by arranging a strip with 5 PCBs (skin patch) on the flat surface of the cover. (see image)

## Assembly instruction.

First of all, it must be said that the electronic part of the upper arm covers is already supplied, that is, the MTB4 cards and the hexagon shape (skin) are mounted, glued and connected together.
Before starting assembly, check the orientation of the covers.<br>

*Perform the assembly sequence as shown in the image, keep in mind that the sequence is the same for both upper arms (Right and left)*<br>

- First step push the cover (RC_IIT_017_P_023) inwards so as to align the attachment holes, both positions (TOP and BOTTOM), as can be seen in the image.
