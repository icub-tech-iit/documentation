## [The iCub Versions Table](./icub_versions/index.md)
[iCub Versions Table](./icub_versions/index.md) is a table containing the current known iCub versions.

## [The iCub Wiring](./icub_wiring/index.md)
[iCub Wiring](./icub_wiring/index.md) contains the documentation about the Logic and Harness schematics of iCub

## [iCub Tendons](./icub_tendons/index.md)
[iCub Tendons](./icub_tendons/index.md) contains the ultimate step-by-step guide on how to replace broken or out of place tendons of the iCub. It includes also some tutorials on how to build forearms and the overall tendons constituting iCub.

## [The Upgrade Kits](./upgrade_kits/index.md)
The design of our robot evolves in time. We have been asking ourselves how to propagate the mechanical or hardare enhancements we design to older robots. Our solution is to define upgrade kits that can be applied to specific robots.

An [upgrade kit](./upgrade_kits/index.md) is a plastic bag with mechanical parts, hardware boards, screws, wires, tendons and whatever it is required to perform a physical upgrade of the robots, including the instructions.

## [iCub Kinematics](./icub_kinematics/index.md)

## [iCub 3](./icub3/icub3-joints.md)
Here are described the elctrical and mechanical specifications for each joint.

## [Hands](./hands/index.md)
Here's reported info about the hands installed on the robots.

## [Wrist](./wrists/index.md)
Here's reported info about the wrists installed on the robots.

## [iCub CPU boards](./icub_cpu_boards/icub_cpu_boards.md)
Here's reported info about CPU boards installed on iCub.

## [F/T Sensors](./ft_sensors/index.md)
Here's reported info about `F/T sensors`.

## [Power push buttons](./robot_power/robot_power_button.md)
Here's reported info about `power push buttons`.
