# iCub Documentation
First draft of iCub documentation.

## [iCub Starter Kit](./icub_starter_kits/first_steps.md)

[First Launch with the Humanoid robot iCub](./icub_starter_kits/first_steps.md) contains the perfect starter guide to handle and check the overall capabilities of iCub.

## [iCub Tendons](./icub_tendons/index.md)
[iCub Tendons](./icub_tendons/index.md) contains the ultimate step-by-step guide on how to replace broken or out of place tendons of the iCub. It includes also some tutorials on how to build forearms and the overall tendons constituting iCub.

## [The Upgrade Kits](./upgrade_kits/index.md)
The design of our robot evolves in time. We have been asking ourselves how to propagate the mechanical or hardare enhancements we design to older robots. Our solution is to define upgrade kits that can be applied to specific robots. 

An [upgrade kit](./upgrade_kits/index.md) is a plastic bag with mechanical parts, hardware boards, screws, wires, tendons and whatever it is required to perform a physical upgrade of the robots, including the instructions.

## [The iCub Versions Table](./icub_versions/index.md)
[iCub Versions Table](./icub_versions/index.md) is a table containing the current known iCub versions.
