# Firmware Documentation
Here you can find informations about updating firmware, changing boards properties and firmware revisions in the various versions of the robot.


## FirmwareUpdater
With the `FirmwareUpdater` application it is possible to perform GUI-based FW update on both CAN- and ETH-based robots; the commonly used functionalities are:

- Upload `application` firmware both on `ETH` boards and `CAN` boards
- Change the `IP addrress` for ethernet based boards
- Change the `CAN ID` for the CAN based boards
- Update the `bootloader` (advanced option)
- Access to the `F/T` sensors calibration data of the `STTRAIN`/`STRAIN2`

## Firmware tools
 With the FirmwareUpdater application it is possible to perform GUI-based FW update on both CAN- and ETH-based robots. 

Here you can find [quick](https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build/blob/master/docs/FirmwareUpdater.readme.quick.txt ) and [detailed](https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build/blob/master/docs/FirmwareUpdater.readme.fulldetails.txt ) instructions.


### Operations on STRAIN with the FirmwareUpdater
The operations on the STRAIN boards described in the above sections can be performed also using the new FirmwareUpdater program.

With reference to Figure 2 inside this [document](https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build/blob/master/docs/FirmwareUpdater.readme.fulldetails.txt) you can do as follows.

- Upload a new FW using the button `Upload Application`. See also section [6](https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build/blob/master/docs/FirmwareUpdater.readme.quick.txt).
- Tick the button `Erase STRAIN EEPROM` and then upload the new FW if you also want to reset the F/T Sensors.
- Launch the STRAIN Calibration GUI with the button `Calibrate STRAIN` if you want to import a calibration data file.

### Firmware versions
A complete description of the different firmware versions used by the DSP boards which control the iCub robot can be found [here](../associated-firmware/associated-firmware.md)


### Automatic update of the robot
The user can also decide to perform the automatic update of the complete robot (or of some of its parts). Inside folder scripts of [repository](https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build) there are some examples.

The user can:

- retrieve info with scripts/FirmwareUpdater.script.info.all.sh,
- query the robot with scripts/FirmwareUpdater.script.verify.all.sh. This command also gives an estimate of the time required to perform the firmware update of the boards with old versions.
- update the firmware of all boards with old versions with scripts/FirmwareUpdater.script.update.all.sh

### The topology of the robot
The robot network is described by the file network.{$YARP_ROBOT_NAME}.xml available for most robots in the [repository](https://github.com/robotology/robots-configuration). In case you cannot find this file, please ask for one [here](https://github.com/robotology/icub-support)

In its inside there is thelist of all boards with their name, drive, address and link relations.

You can view some of this information with:

- scripts/FirmwareUpdater.script.info.all.sh: it prints the list of all boards with all details
- scripts/FirmwareUpdater.script.topology.all.sh: it prints the list of all ETH boards in link order.

### Advanced operations
The user can also launch FirmwareUpdater in administration mode to perform advance (but also potentially destructive) operations:

- change IP or CAN address,
- change bootstrap mode of boards,
- upload special system processes which helps maintenance and execution of the application,
- management of strain and strain2 boards.
  
For how to operate in this mode please refer to [this](https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build/doc)

### Robot Versions and Firmware
Below you'll find a detailed description of the various robot versions, in particular for the `board` type-`id` or `ip address`-`firmware` associations. and the services offered by each board.

### CanLoader Tool (deprecated)
In the past the tool used to deal with firmware update operations was the [CanLoader](./../canLoader/canLoader.md) tool that has been removed since this [PR](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main/pull/659)
