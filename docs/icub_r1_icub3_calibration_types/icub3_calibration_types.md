# Calibration types available on iCub 3
The table below aims to provide expert users with some technical information about calibration types on `iCub3` robot.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Calibration name</td><td>Description</td><td>Procedure</td><td>Notes</td></tr><tr><td>rotor-stator autocalibration</td><td>automatic procedure to find the offset between the index position in the motor and the position that corresponds to zero electrical degrees in the stator &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>to be executed after the first mechanical assembly and every time for some reason the stator needs to be unmounted from its housing</td></tr><tr><td>rotor index calibration</td><td>at every startup of the robot, the motor moves in order to find the index of the reflective encoder &nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>joint zero calibration</td><td>TBD &nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>AMO calibration</td><td>The AMO sensor needs to be calibrated with an external device. The calibration parameters are stored on an EEPROM that is in the AMO board</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>every time the magnetic target or the AMO board are moved a bit from their position (the calibration takes into account the position between the target and the sensor mounted on the board)&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Joint Limits and Zero calibration</td><td>&nbsp;Put the robot in the zero position and acquire the value of the AMO sensor</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>only once &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>joint startup calibration</td><td>The joint moves to a specific position&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>at every startup after rotor index calibration</td></tr></tbody></table>
