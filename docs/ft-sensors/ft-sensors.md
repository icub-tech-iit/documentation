# F/T Sensors
The F/T sensor (6-dof) has also been specially designed to fit the iCub. However, the size of the sensor has been made compatible with an existing commercial product. On the other hand the signal conditioning electronics has been made to fit the sensor itself, consequently reducing the space required. The F/T sensor is based on a classical [Wheatstone bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge) design employing 12 semiconductor strain gauges arranged in a 6 half-bridges configuration.ed robots

## **Mechanical specifications**

### Physical specifications
----
The physical specifications of the sensor are reported in Table 1:

|          |                                                               |

| Weight   | 0.122\[kg\] |
| Diameter | 45\[mm\] |
| Height   | 18.4\[mm\] |
Table 1: Physical specifications of the sensor

### Measurement frame specifications
----
![F/T Sensor Frame](./img/ft-frame.png)

he F/T sensor reference frame. Please notice that key elements to localize the reference frame on the sensor are two: (1) the hole where the CAN exits the sensor and (2) the thick VS the thin sensor cover.

The sensor is calibrated to measure the Force/Torque applied by the upper (blue) part of the sensor on the lower (red) part of sensor, and express it on the F/T sensor reference frame.

### Calibration specifications
---
The sensors are calibrated in order to obtain high resolution in typical operating regions. Typical values of the range and resolution for a sensor after the calibration procedure are reported in Table 2. The resolution is typical for most applications and can be improved with filtering. Resolutions quoted are the effective resolution after dropping three counts of noise.

### Creo CAD model
---
The CAD model of FTSens is available in the hardware [repository](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/cad-mechanics-public/tree/master/projects/common/ic_008_ft45_M4) of the `icub-tech-iit` organization on `GitHub`.

In particular the FT sensor assembly name is `ic_008_a_001.asm.1`.

### Additional info
---
Additional specification are reported in this [document](./assets/FTSens.pdf).

For more info on how to load the firmware and the calibration matrix on a FT sensor, check the documentation page on [Firmware](../icub_firmware/firmware/firmware.md).

### Electronics
---
There are three versions of the electronic board of the iCub's FT sensor: STRAIN (also known as STRAIN1), STRAIN1.5 or STRAIN2. All this electronic boards sample the analog strain gauges voltages, and expose the measurements over a CAN interface.

Low-level documentation and materials about the `STRAIN2` board is available [here](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/electronics-boards-public/tree/master/sensor-boards/strain2) .
