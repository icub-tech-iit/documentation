## iCub 2.x Wiring 


- The logic schematics consist of the logical and electrical connections between boards, sensors and motors. 
- The harness schematics are the drawings of all the cables and bundles.
- In the image below, you will find the position of all the harnesses that you find in the pdf. 
- In order to find a cable in the Harness file of your robot, you should start looking at this picture to find out where you have to look at. 
- The Motor&Board_Placement is the document where you can find the wireframe of the robot with all the electronic boards, motors and sensors labels.
