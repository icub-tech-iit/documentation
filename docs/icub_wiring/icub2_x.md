## iCub 2.x Wiring 


Logic schematics are logical and electrical connections between boards, sensors and motors. 
Harness schematics there are the drawings of all the cables and bundles. 
In the mage below you will find the position of all the harness that you find in the pdf. 
In order to find a cable in the Harness file of your robot, you should start looking at this picture to find out where you have to look at. 
The Motor&Board_Placement is the document where you can find the wireframe of the robot with all the electronic boards, motors and sensors labels.
