# Install iCub software from pre-compiled binaries on Windows

We support installation on Windows using the pre-compiled Windows installer available for the robotology-superbuild. For more info, check [the `robotology-superbuild` documentation](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild#windows-from-binaries). This page contains a recap of the instructions necessary to use this installer.

## Instructions

Download and execute the Robotology installer available from [[Downloads]]. Pick up the binaries containing the `full-installer` file. When prompted with the dialog below, **do not change the destination directory** as the archive still contains a few packages that are not fully relocatable.
