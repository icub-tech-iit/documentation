# Calibration type 10 details - AMO Encoder Joint Calibration

This section illustrates the details of the calibration procedure used for the `iCub 3/ergoCub` joints that mount an AMO encoder at the slow shaft.
As already detailed in the [`calibration-10-procedure`](./standard_calibration_types.md/#calibration-10) joints provided with the `AMO` encoder are currently calibrated so that it can be handled as an incremental encoder coupled with a quadrature encoder placed at the motor.

## Calibration workflow

Complete pipeline for the `calibration type 10` using `AMO encoder` at joint and `quadrature encoder` at motor.

As you can see in the above-reported state machine, after the calibration command is received by the EMS, a timer of 30 seconds gets triggered; afterward, we wait until the motor encoder calibration ends; finally, the calibration procedure 10 commences.

The procedure basically consists in moving the slow shaft towards one of the hardware limits as defined in the position set within the calibration parameter `calibrationZero`. The value of the PWM used is in turn defined through the parameter `calibration1`. The joint moves until the limit is reached within a time window and within a predefined maximum length, whose values are coded in the firmware.

Finally, if the `hard-stop` limit position is found before the `CALIBRATION TIMEOUT` expires, the zero of the `AMO encoder` is updated with the found offset and the whole calibration completes correctly; otherwise, the joint is moved to the `NOT CONFIGURED` state, the PWM is set to `zero` and the motor switched to `IDLE`.

The FW verifies if the joint has reached the hard position by checking that the encoder position does not change for 1 second, meaning that the relative increase of joint position is smaller than 6.5 deg (1200 iCubDegrees) within 1 second. The encoder position considered for the check is processed to filter out the spikes.
