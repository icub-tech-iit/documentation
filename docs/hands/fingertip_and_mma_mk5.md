## Hand Sensors

### Finger sensors
Tactile sensors are deployed on the fingertip. 
The fingertip comprises a 3DMID piece with the patterned taxels and a conventional PCB (the **FT3D**) reading the capacitances and hosting an IMU. 

The taxel mapping is represented in Fig. 1.

### FT3D board configuration - rev. 2 
The AD7147 hosted on the FT3D has configurable **I2C address**  to allow for multiple devices. 

The congfiguration is made through the jumpers **AD0** and **AD1** reported in Fig. 2 by simply soldering 
the desired connection on the dedicated jumper. Also **R1** is to be removed in this revision. 
Depending on the connection (see below) the **IMU** also needs to be removed.

    <sub>Fig.2 – Address configuration: the board represented has Address bits (AD0, AD1) = (0, 0).</sub>
</p>

Since the **IMU** is not equipped with similar configurable address pins, we need to remove all the IMUs from unwanted boards before the installation. This will be fixed in rev. 3 of the FT3D.

The complete configuration set is as follow:

    In ergoCub SN000 currently the fingertips are not wired to the MMA board.

<p align="center">
    <sub>Fig.4 - fixing the 3DMID to the soldering support.</sub>
</p>

- Fix the 3DMID to the soldering support with 1.6x6mm screw.
- Plug the soldering support on the base.

<p align="center">
    <sub>Fig.5 – soldering support plugged into the base.</sub>
</p>

- Set the soldering iron to 250 C, apply flux and pre-tin the pads on the 3DMID.
- Apply flux and pre-tin the castellated holes on FT3DB.
- Configure the FT3DB jumpers (see section above).
- Place the FT3DB on the 3DMID aligning the soldering pads.
- Apply some flux if needed and solder a couple of pads holding the FT3DB in position.
- Go on and solder all the pads.

At this point the device is ready for testing, just connect it to the MMA with the dedicated cable. 
To fully mount the fingertip, proceed with the next steps:

- Put on the rubber fingertip cod. 17377.

<p align="center">
    <sub>Fig.7 – adjusted rubber fingertip on 3DMID shell.</sub>
</p>

- Test the fingertip in this condition.

          width=  "500">
</p>
<p align="center">
    <sub>Fig.8 – 3DMID fingertips with and without the rubber cap.</sub>
</p>

- To mount on the finger distal phalanx (fig. 9):
    1. Connect the cable exiting from the phalanx.
    2. Slide the rear of the assembly into the bore with a small inclination.
    3. Push up and ahead to insert the locking clip into its slot.

At this point, the assembly should look sturdy and precisely fit, in addition you can tighten it with **1.6x8 mm screw**. Now it's ready for testing the signals.

### Encoders
The finger position (closing and adduction angles) are read out by a set of FAP cards (Finger Absolute Position), each one coupled with a small magnet rigidly connected to the corresponding joint.
Each FAP has the same I2C address, thus **one I2C data line is needed for one FAP**. This is implemented at the PCB level. 

## MMA Connection scheme
Three Molex 8-Pin connectors are the inputs for three dedicated MTB cards:
- One MTB for tactile reading.
- Two MTBs for FAP reading: max. 8 FAPs can be connected (4x MTB).

The power suppy and signals are then routed to the connectors towards the FAPs and Fingertips:
- **JST SURS** 5 contacts for the fingertips.
- **JST XRS** 4 contacts for the FAPs.

The family of connectors on the same device are identified with the REF DES: i.e., Picoblade **J1** goes to connectors **J1** 1, **J1** 2 and so on; Picoblade **J2** goes to **J2** 1 etc. 
Details are summarized in the table below:

| connector | description | sensor | 
|--|--|--|
|**J1** | Molex 8-Pin | conventional MTB |
|**J2** | Molex 8-Pin | MTB-FAP  |
|**J3** | Molex 8-Pin | MTB-FAP  |
| J10-J15 | JST SURS  | fingertips and palm - corresponding to **J1** |
| J20-J23 | JST XRS | encoders - corresponding to **J2** |
| J30-J33 | JST XRS | encoders - corresponding to **J3** |

The encoders are connected with the following logic:
- Finger position encoders are to be routed to one MTB-FAP.
- Adduction encoders are to be routed to the other MTB-FAP.

The choice of the MTB-FAP can be made allowing for the simplest layout.

The schematic of the MMA is shown below.

### Tactile sensors

</p>
<p align="center">
    <sub>Fig.3 – Skin connections. The fingers belonging to the same Data Line can be swapped.</sub>
</p>

The tactile sensors are connected to the MMA as in Fig. 3. The fingers (index, middle, ring) can be swapped to account for easier cabling, with no effect in mapping of the signals. Also, Thumb and Pink can be swapped the similarly.

### Encoder connection
The encoders are connected as reported in the table above and in the schematic snapshot in Fig. 4.

## Software items
To use correctly the data from the sensors we need to have the following information embedded in the configuration files.

### Signal wrapping in configuration files 
For the configuration of the **Wrapper file** in the robots-configuration tree, for streaming through the **YARP** 
services and signal visualization, the mapping of the signals is reported in the table below:

#### ergoCub SN000 & SN001

| Finger | board nr. | Taxel Index | 
|-- |--|--|
| Thumb  | 4 | 48-59  | 
| Index  | 0 | 0-11   | 
| Middle | 1 | 12-23  | 
| Ring   | 2 | 24-35  | 
| Pink   | 5 | 60-71  | 
| Palm   | TBD |TBD |  

#### ergoCub SN000 & SN001

| Finger | board nr. | Taxel Index |
|-- |--|--|
| Thumb  | 0 | 0-11  | 
| Index  | 1 | 12-23 |
| Middle | 2 | 24-35 |
| Ring   | 3 | 36-47 |
| Pink   | 4 | 48-59 |
| Palm   | TBD | TBD |

### AD7147 configuration
The values for the mk2 fingertip are reported here, to be implemented in **.xml files** with the proper labeling:

| Parameter |  Value | 
|--|--|
| Bitshift | 2 |
| CDC offset | 0x0000 | 
| No load value | note[^1] |

[^1]: the No load value can be choosen to be lower than 0xF0 (240) to allow for some room for opposite polarity signals to be recorded. In this case the set level must be forwarded to 
high level tools such as SkinGUI etc. for a proper managing of events. A nice choice could be a value of about 0xC0 (192) to have ~60 ADC counts of headroom for oppposite sign forces 
i.e. shear forces to be measured with the lateral taxels or elastic effects for non-touched taxels to improve force measurement.

### Encoders mapping in the configuration files
