## Coupling laws

Considering the following quantities:

$$b = \left| L_{0} - P_{0} \right|$$

$$d = \left| P_{1} - P_{0} \right|$$

$$l = \left| L_{1} - P_{1} \right|$$

$$k = \left| L_{1} - L_{0} \right|$$

$$s = \left| B - P_{0} \right|$$

$$t = |A - B|$$

$$f = |A - C|$$

$$r = |D - C|$$

$$h(q_{1}) = \left| P_{1}(q_{1}) - L_{0} \right|$$

$$a(q_{0}) = \left| A(q_{0}) - P_{0} \right|$$

$$P_{1x} = P_{0x} + d\cos\left( q_{1} + q_{1off} \right)$$

$$P_{1y} = P_{0y} + d\sin\left( q_{1} + q_{1off} \right)$$

$$A_{x} = C_{x} + f\cos\left( q_{0} + q_{0off} \right)$$

$$A_{y} = C_{y} + f\sin\left( q_{0} + q_{0off} \right)$$

We have **$q_{2}$**  that depends only on the
variable **$q_{1}$** through the implicit dependence on **$P_{1}$** and **h**:

$$q_{2} = \tan^{- 1}\left( \frac{P_{1y}(q_{1}) - L_{0y}}{P_{1x}(q_{1}) - L_{0x}} \right) + \cos^{- 1}{\left( \frac{l^{2} - k^{2} + h^{2}(q_{1})}{2lh(q_{1})} \right) - q_{2bias}}$$

The Jacobian that relates the variations of **$q_{2}$** to the variations of **$q_{1}$** is:

$$\frac{\partial q_{2}}{\partial q_{1}} = \frac{1}{2 - \frac{d^{2} - b^{2}}{d^{2} - L_{0} \bullet P_{1}}} + \frac{\left( L_{0x}P_{1y} - L_{0y}P_{1x} \right)\left( l^{2} - k^{2} - h^{2} \right)}{2lh^{3}\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{l^{2} - k^{2} + h^{2}}{2lh} \right)^{2}}}$$

The relationship between **$q_{0}$** and **$q_{1}$** is:

$$q_{1} = \tan^{- 1}\left( \frac{A_{y}(q_{0}) - P_{0y}}{A_{x}(q_{0}) - P_{0x}} \right) + \cos^{- 1}{\left( \frac{s^{2} - t^{2} + a^{2}(q_{0})}{2sa(q_{0})} \right) - q_{1bias}}$$
