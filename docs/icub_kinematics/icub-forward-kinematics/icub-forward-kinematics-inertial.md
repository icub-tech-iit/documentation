# ICubInertiaSensorKinematics

## V1
Here's described how to construct the matrix T_RoIs whose definition is given in [ICubForwardKinematics](./icub-forward-kinematics.md). The matrix is constructed in three steps i.e. `T_RoIs = T_Ro0 * T_0n * T_nIs`. The first matrix T_Ro0 describes the rigid roto-translation from the root reference frame to points in the 0th reference frame as defined by the [Denavit-Hartenberg convention](./assets/chap3-forward-kinematics.pdf). In this case T_Ro0 is just a rigid rotation which aligns the z-axis with the first joint of the waist. The second matrix T_0n correspond to the Denavit-Hartenberg description of the waist and neck forward kinematic, i.e. the roto-translation from the 0th reference frame to the nth reference frame being n the number of degrees of freedom. The forward kinematic T_0n in this case includes the waist and the neck forward kinematics.

The matrix T_0n is itself the composition of n matrices as defined by the DH convention: `T_0n = T_01 T_12 ... T_(n-1)n`. 
Here is the updated [matlab](./assets/ICubFwdKinNew.zip) code for computing the forward kinematics with the Denavit Hartenberg notation

The sensor reference frame is located in the palm as shown in the CAD figure.

Here is the matrix `T\_Ro0`:

|     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | -1  | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | -1  | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |

Here is the table of the actual DH parameters which describe `T\_01,T\_12, ... T\_(n-1)n`.

| Link i / H – D | Ai (mm) | d\_i (mm) | alpha\_i (rad) | theta\_i (deg)       |
|----------------|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| i = 0          | 32      | 0         | pi/2           | -22 -&gt; 84         |
| i = 1          | 0       | -5.5      | pi/2           | -90 + (-39 -&gt; 39) |
| i = 2          | 2.31    | -193.3    | -pi/2          | -90 + (-59 -&gt; 59) |
| i = 3          | 33      | 0         | pi/2           | 90 + (-40 -&gt; 30)  |
| i = 4          | 0       | 1         | -pi/2          | -90 + (-70 -&gt; 60) |
| i = 5          | 22.5    | 100.5     | -pi/2          | 90 + (-55 -&gt; 55)  |

Here is the matrix `T\_nIs`:

|     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | -1  | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 6.6 |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |

In some circumstances it might be convenient to think of coding T\_nls
as a further virtual link located at the end of the chain and with its
joint constantly kept at 0 value. The DH parameters of this virtual link
are:

| Link i / H – D | Ai (mm) | d\_i (mm) | alpha\_i (rad) | theta\_i (deg) |
|----------------|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| i = 6          | 0       | 6.6       | pi/2           | 0              |
