# HOWTO REPAIR ANY CABLE FROM A FOREARM or HAND - VERSION 2

## 1	LOWER ARM VERSION 2

> Let's have an overview of the mechanical CAD from different view angles.

### 				1.1	Rules of Thumb for a good start:

> 1 - Visual inspection (remove the covers - around the forearm and above the hand - and look for broken cables)
>
> 2 - Identification (which part needs to be repaired)
>
> 3 - Cleaning and Removing the broken cable
>
> 4 - Follow the instructions below to repair

### 				1.2	Disconnection

A good question on which people may have when first try to repair the Forearm is:<br/> "Do I need to disconnect the Lower Arm?"

The answer is as follow:

| What is broken?                                              | REMOVING OR NOT   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **distal joint** (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring or Pinkie)      | **NOT** necessary |
| **every other joint** (all proximal, fingers abduction and Thumb oppose ) | **MANDATORY**     |

Please refer to this following [**link**](remove.md#2-lower-arm-v2) to get know HOWTO disconnect the Lower Arm V2.

## 2	Distal Joints

If ever you realize that one of the following cable is broken bear in mind:

There are 2 types of distal Joint on this version of the forearm:

* The simplest ones - which go inside a motor shaft to get anchored - as soon as the motor is spinning the cable rolls around the pulley and close the joint. Those motors are <u>*perfectly*</u> identical - only the positions differ :

  > Thumb, Index & Middle distal joints

* The 2 trickiest ones which are actually a double distal joint in one motor.

  > Ring and Pinkie Fingers




### 	2.1	Location

The first question to answer will be "Where are those cables located?"

Here is the table to locate all the distal joints on a forearm (**left** in this case)



| LOCATION | JOINT  | POSITION |
| ---- | ----- | --|
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/index_middle_V2.png" height=auto width=600> | Index and Middle | they are located **ATOP** the forearm when it <u>lies</u> palm face **DOWN** |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/TH_R&P_V2.png" height=auto width=600> | Thumb distal **AND** Ring and Pinkie | They are located **ATOP** when the forearm <u>lies</u> palm face **UP** |

| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src='../img/lowerArm/knot1.jpg' width =400>        | Start by cutting one piece of 40cm from the cable IITCODE 2391.<br />Make a knot at one extremity. |
| <img src="../gif/lower_arm/knot_video.gif" width = 400> | Use 2 pliers to close it hard. The plier closest to the knot is just opened-free to let the cable to run over it but is here to block the knot, the second one pull the cable to tighten the knot. |
| <img src='../img/lowerArm/knot3.jpg' width = 400>       | Drop a tear of glue on the knot and dry it. <br>**REMOVE** the excess with a tissue - double check that the knot is perfectly dry before to proceed. |
| <img src='../img/lowerArm/knot4.jpg' width = 400>       | Cut the excess of cable.                                     |
| <img src='../img/lowerArm/knot5.jpg' width = 400>       | FINISHED!!!                                                  |

!!! danger "WATCH OUT"
    FOR the **Right** forearm : the motor positions are "mirrored" respect to the **Left** ones.


#### 			<u>			RING AND PINKIE:</u>

!!!note
    Those fingers need to be done **together** in order to make sure that both cables close simultaneously.

|                                                          | 1. Prepare 2 cables of about 40 cm of IITCODE 2391 and make sure you make the knot as taught above. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/hole_dist.png" width=600> |!!!watch out!!! the 2 holes are a bit off one to another: make sure, with a fat screwdriver, that the pulley is NOT 180 degrees rotated or else the cables could jump one on another during the closing phase. |

| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/P_R.png" width=400> | 3. Push the 2 cables in the sheath until they get out from the 2 holes circled. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/R_P_cabling.png" width=600>         | 4. Cable routing.<br />To be able to pass the cable at the base of the nail it is important to remove the nail and move forward the fingertip for 1 cm from its base. |
| picture sul vero robot | 5. Please write with a marker at the base of the nails where the knot should be in order to have a perfect simultaneous closing for both fingers. |

 

!!!tip
    The insertion of the cables into their holes, passing through the pulleys, is tricky. If you are struggling, cut the cable extremity with a **45 deg angle**, so it will be easier for it to get in position.

If you ever realize that one of the following cable is broken bear in mind:

!!!tip
    The start of the wiring for each proximal is identical (wiring around the motor pulley). The index and middle proximal joints are cabled exactly the same way, just the thumb is a bit trickier.




### 				3.2	WIRING

#### 									3.2.1	Preparation

The minimum requirement to start re-cabling the proximal joints is:

| IITCODE | Alias    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1815    | CG077063 | Stainless steel micro-cable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. diameter 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 |

#### 									3.2.2	Cabling the Motor Pulley

| LOCATION   | step by step guide      |
| --- | --- |
|       | Take 1 meter of IITCODE 1815.            |
|<img src ="../img/lowerArm/start_prox.png" width=700> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/start_prox1.png" width=400>| Turn the pulley in order to have the threads already facing (pointing toward) the holes inside the pink frame and the hole inside the pulley itself lying at horizontal. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox1.png" width=800> <br> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/ProximalV2.png" width=800> <br> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/pull_cable.png" width=800> | Insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both sides of the pulley. In order to differentiate the two cable parts, we will call them red and blue. <br><br> !!!TIP!!! In order to keep in position the cable  split in two halves, pull it like shown in the last pic |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox_pulley3.png" width=400> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox_pulley.png" width=400>  <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox_pulley2.png" width=400><br> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/hold_cable.png" width=400> | Respect the only one rule: 2 full turns around the pulley for the hole close to the ball bearing (blue cable) and 1 full turn for the part that will go into the hole the closest from the motor (red cable). <br><br> In order to keep the cable in position after the turns, you can push it with a screwdriver like shown in this last picture |



!!!tip
    YOU may need to glue the cable at the tip (2cm long) on both sides. With a plier make 2 times 90 degree angles on the cable at about 3-4mm from one another, in order to create a hook. Extract the cable once it passes between the thread and the neck of the frame. <img src ="../img/lowerArm/hook.png" width=600>



!!!tip
    When inserting the cable in the pulley, make sure that the pulley holes are in phase with the frame holes. In other words, the pulley threads need to be aligned with the 2 holes in the frame. 



| LOCATION   | step by step guide      |

|  | !!!!WARNING!!! the cabling for the thumb passes first by a pair of pulleys before returning to a perfectly identical cabling as Index and Middle. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/holes_prox.png" width=600> | After wrapping the cable on the pulley, insert the 2 cable extremities inside the frame holes. For the thumb, the frame holes are designed inclined by 45 deg. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/exit_prox.png" width=400>            | Push the 2 sides of the cable inside the sheath (+) and (-) for each finger. |
|   | **The 2 sides of the cables should get out:** |

| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/exit_prox_I&M.png" width=700> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/exit_prox_thumb2.png" width=700> | For all the proximal joints the final cabling starts at the base of their respective finger. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/last_pulley_prox.png" width=700>    | Cable as follow and block each side of the cable with the nut screw M1.6x3 |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/nutscrewV2.png" width=700> | Tense each side of the cable by releasing the nut screw and pinch and rotate. Close the nut screw. |
|  | Make a knot at the base of the cable exit, a little further away from it **(+/-5 mm)** AND keep in mind that the **knot** will have to **remain in the slot**. |
|  | **FINISHED!!!** |
