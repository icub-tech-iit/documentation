## 1.1 Rules of Thumb for a good start:

> 1 - Visual inspection (remove the covers - around the forearm and above the hand - and check for broken cables)
>
> 2 - Identification (which part needs to be repaired)
>
> 3 - Cleaning and Removing the broken cable



## 2 Distal Joints

There are 2 types of distal Joints on this version of the forearm:

* The ones which go inside a motor shaft to get anchored and, as soon as the motor is spinning, the cable rolls around the pulley and closes the joint. Those motors are <u>*perfectly*</u> identical - only the positions differ:

  > Thumb, Index & Middle fingers

* The ones which are attached to the slider:

  > Ring and Pinkie fingers

### 2.1 Location

| WHERE  | JOINT   | POSITION       |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/V1-distal-thumb.png" width=500> | Thumb distal     | <u>easy to find:</u> no **slider** above or hiding it. It is also right next to the motor with the cage |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/index_middle_V1.png" width=500> | Index and Middle | they are located **<u>beneath</u>** the slider  (other side of the wrist, external) |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/R&P_V1.png" width=600> | Ring and Pinkie   | they are attached onto the moving part of the slider (internal) |

    FOR the **Left forearm** : the motor positions are "mirrored" respect to the **right** ones.

### 2.2 Cabling

#### 2.2.1 Preparation

The minimum requirement to start recabling:

| IITCODE | Alias    | Description    |

#### 2.2.2 Knot creation

|  | STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR A GOOD KNOT |
|---|---|
|<img src='../img/lowerArm/knot1.jpg' width =400>|Start by cutting one piece of 40cm from the cable IITCODE 2391.<br />Make a knot at one extremity.|
|<img src="../gif/lower_arm/knot_video.gif" width = 400>|use 2 pliers to close it hard. The plier closest to the knot is just opened-free to let the cable to run over it but is here to block the knot, the second one pull the cable to tighten the knot. Place the pliers on the same side, in order to not damage the cable.|

| <img src="../img/lowerArm/Th_I_O_new.png" width = 700>       | In order to recable this joint, just insert the new cable **IN** side the hole (red circle - blue arrow) - the hole is in the internal side of the pulley cage. Once inserted, the cable should get **OUT** at the base of the phalange (red arrow). |
| <img src="../img/lowerArm/Thumb_cableV1.png" width = 700> <img src="../img/lowerArm/Thumb_parallelV1.png" width = 700> | From the base of the phalange, insert the cable in the two pulleys following the path (red), ensuring that the cable remains parallel while looping (see bottom picture). |
|                                                              | For closing the cable, make it exit from the hole at the base of the nail and secure it in its socket with a knot 1-2cm away from the exit of the nail. |

#### 2.2.5 Ring and Pinkie

These 2 fingers actually form a single distal joint and are in fact driven by a single motor.

!!!note
    Those fingers need to be done **together** in order to make sure that both cable close simultaneously.

The 2 fingers are so actuated by 3 wires - 2 for the distal cables inside the fingers and 1 inside the motor shaft which moves the slider. For each cabling please follow the procedures below.

##### 2.2.5a  Cabling for the motor side


Here you can find the procedure for the cabling of the motor side - responsible for the slider movement:

##### 2.2.5b Cabling for the fingers


| Pictures | step by step guide       |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| | 1. Prepare 2 cables of 40 cm of IITCODE 2391 and make sure you make the knot as taught above |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/R&P_V1.png" width= 600> | 2.  The starting points of the cabling are the 2 holes of the slider |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/ring e pinkie position_0.jpg" width= 500> |  3 .pass both cables inside the parallel holes and then in thiers sheats |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/P_R.png" width= 300> | 4. the exit of both cables is at the base of the phalange |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/R_P_cabling.png" width=800> | 5. cable routing (same rules as other fingers). <br />To be able to pass the cable at the base of the nail it is important to create space by removing the nail (plastic cover) and moving forward the fingertip for 1 cm from its base. |
| | 6. please write with a marker at the base of the nails where the knot should be in order to have a perfect synchronous closing for both fingers. |
| |7. Now close manually the 2 fingers to get some slack to the cable and pull it out a bit to see where you should create the knot - at the very end of the mark on the cable.|
| | 8. If you did good, when releasing the fingers they should be symmetrical |

If ever you realize that one of the following cable is broken bear in mind:

!!!TIP
    The start of the wiring for each proximal is identical (wiring around the motor pulley), the index and middle proximal joints are cabled exactly the same way, just the thumb is a bit trickier.

### 3.2 Cabling

#### 3.2.1 Preparation

The minimum requirement to start recabling the proximal joints is:

| IITCODE | Alias    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1815    | CG077063 | Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 |

#### 3.2.1 Cabling of the motor pulley & fingers

Let' start with the cabling of the motor pulley.

| Pictures                                                     | step by step guide                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                                              | Take 1 meter of IITCODE 1815                                 |
|                                                              | The following steps are common for the three fingers (index, middle, thumb). However, the holes for the thumb in the frame are slightly different (see next table). |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/start_prox.png" width=400> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/start_prox1.png" width=400> | Turn the pulley in order to have the threads already facing (pointing toward) the holes inside the pink frame and the hole inside the pulley itself lying at horizontal. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox1.png" width=400>      | insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both side of the pulley. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox_pulley3.png" width=400> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox_pulley.png" width=400><br /> <img src ="../img/lowerArm/wiring_prox_pulley2.png" width=400> | Respect the only one rule: 2 full turns around the pulley for the hole close to the ball bearing (blue cable) and 1 full turn for the part of the cable that will go into the hole the closest from the motor (red cable). |



!!!tip
    YOU may need to use the cable , glue it a the tip (2 cm long) on both side. With a plier make 2 times 90 degree angles on the cable at about 3-4 mm from one another. see picture to manage to extract the cable once it passes in between the thread and the neck of the frame.
    !!!PICTURE NEEDED!!!!

Now we proceed with the cabling of the fingers.

| Pictures                                                     | step by step guide                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Holes_indexmiddle_V1.png" width=700> | After wrapping the cable on the pulley as shown before, insert the two cable extremities inside the frame holes for the Index & Middle. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Holes_thumb.png" width=700>       | For the thumb, the frame holes are designed inclined by 45 deg, therefore the cables will not enter the frame perpendicularly as the previous case. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Section_motorsV1.png" width=700>  | Push the two sides of the cable inside the sheath (+) and (-) for each finger. |
|                                                              | **The 2 sides of the cables should get out:**                |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Thumb_cablesV1.png" width=700>    | For the Thumb: the cables exit from the base of the finger and enter inside two sheaths. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Section_indexmiddleV1.png" width=500> | For Index & Middle the cables exit at the base of their respective finger. |
|                                                              | **Final cabling:**                                           |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Cabling_thumbV1.png" width=500>   | For the Thumb, pass the cables around the pulley as shown. Start with the blue one. Fix the ends of the cables with a knot. |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/Final_proximalV1.png" width=700>  | Same procedure for the other fingers and make a knot at the end. |
|                                                              | **FINISHED!!!**                                              |



!!!TIP
    The final cabling is tricky. First, remember to CLOSE the tensioner of each cable before starting the cabling. If you leave the tensioners open, the cabling will not work. For making the final knot, put a mark on the blue cable and knot it. Slowly turn the motor CCW/CW while pulling the red extremity, ensuring that the cable is correctly running on the motor pulley. When the finger is completely closed pull the red cable and put a mark where the knot will be. Proceed by making the knot the closest to the mark. Finally, you can use the tensioners for removing the slack.
