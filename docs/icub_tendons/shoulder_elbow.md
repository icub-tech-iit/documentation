# Shoulder & Elbow

This chapter describes the wiring procedure for the cables of the shoulders and elbows, for every version of iCub made from version 1 to version 2.5, either in mounting phase or during a maintenance.

<!--
Spalle e gomiti
Il presente Capitolo descrive la procedura di cablaggio dei cavi delle spalle e dei gomiti di tutte le versioni dei Robot realizzati dalla versione 1 alla versione 2.5, sia in fase di costruzione che in fase di manutenzione

!!! note "Rules for a good start"
    1.Always remove the broken cable

    2.Pay attention of putting the tensionner upside down so that the crimp does not exit
    
    3a.Keep in Mind that the shoulder is a set of 4 pairs of antagonistic cables : (1-2), (3-4), (8-7), (6-5)
    
    3b.And by so,to put back in place one pair of cable you need to make sure that the tensioners for both cables are loose

### 2.1	Left Shoulder Rotation Cable 1 and 2



If you have to repair cable 1 and/or cable 2, it is convenient to first:

1. Remove the chest cover (follow [this procedure](waist_legs.md#21-chest-back-and-back-pack-covers-dismounting)) in order to have better access to the pulleys
2. Loose also the cables 5-6-7-8 in order to easily turn the pulleys of cables 1&2 and thus tension them
3. Tension cables 1 and 2, attach the other cables and finally tension them



In order to access the tensioners of cables 1 and 2, you have to remove the small metal cover on both pulleys, as shown below, by unscrewing the M2x5 screw holding them:

|              Tensioner cover              |           Tensioner cover CAD model            |

Let's see the cabling of tendons 1 & 2 in detail:

> Follow the diagram above to route the cable N1. Once the head of the crimp reach the small pulley. Add atop of it the left crimp cover in ABS

<!--
Una volta cablato   il cavo, nel passaggio del cavo attorno alla puleggia piccola   RC_TLR_003_P_037 posizionare il copri cavo in abs (plastica) ovvero il   pezzo  IIT_003_P_006_00 SX
-->

!!! Danger
    You need to remove both tensioners of cable 2 and 3 in order to change one of them - meaning re-cabling pairs (1-2) and (3-4)

<center><img src='../img/shoulder/ICUB_SHOULDER_LEFT_Cable_2.png' width=90%></center> 

> Route cable N2 as per the diagram above.
> 
> Now you can tense both screws for tension cable 1 and 2

!!! TIP
    Do cycles of 5 turns for each screws in order to find an equal tensioning
    

Make sure you face the crimps as shown below before tensioning, in order to have access to them. The down pulley should be rotated like shown:



|                                             |                                                  |

### <u>IMPORTANT NOTES</u> for Cable from 8 to 5

!!! danger "From cable 8 to 5"
    **To mount the cables 8 - 7 - 6 - 5, it is important to start with all of them already disconnected. You   first need to replace the broken cable(s) by starting to enter the head crimp   (4mm size – smaller one or ball crimp) of the cable 7 and 8 inside their respective   tensioner. You will need later to start wiring cable 7 and 8 in their future   path BUT to do so it is necessary to create SPACE FOR THE CRIMPS TO PASS.**
    
    **There are 2 designs for the   shoulder so it is necessary to see the difference in between both of them to know how to untighten the good pieces and screws to create that SPACE**

<h3>VERSION 1</h3>
<center>![ICUB-SHOULDER](./img/shoulder/ICUB_SHOULDER_LEFT_Cable_5-6-7-8.png)</center>
> 1. Remove the beige pulley (remove the 4 screws M2x12) until you don't remount cable 5
> 2. Reach the 2 screws M4x12 on the green pulley and just untighten them until you can pass both crimp 8 and 7 following the routing explain below.
> 3. Close the gap in order to prevent the cables 8 and 7 to exit - tighten the 2 screws M4x12
> 4. Start wiring

<h3>VERSION 2</h3>
![ICUB-SHOULDER](./img/shoulder/ICUB_SHOULDER_LEFT_Cable_5-6-7-8_V2.png)

> 1. Loose the the 2 screws M4x12 to slide a bit the block of 2 pulleys (grey and yellow) to give space until you can pass both crimp 8 and 7 following the routing explain below.
> 2. Close the gap in order to prevent the cables 8 and 7 to exit - tighten the 2 screws M4x12
> 3. Start wiring

In order to insert these cables, you need to turn the 2 pulleys and align the teeth as shown in the picture above.



> Once both crimps jumped over the 2 teeth holding the crimp in position - you can start tightening the screws of the tensioners 7 and 8.

### 2.4	Left Shoulder Elevation Cable 6 and 5

> Those 2 cables are quite straight forward to mount, just follow the 2 following pictures.

## 3	Left Elbow cabling 

> Those 2 cables are not specifically difficult to route but unfortunately you need to operate cautiously to do NOT damage the electronical boards located beneath the upper arm.

!!! warning
    **EITHER** you remove the Lower Arm by Following the instructions for Lower Arm [**V1**](remove.md#position001) or Lower Arm [**V2**](remove.md#position002)
    

    **OR** You are helped by **someone else** to hold the Lower Arm (Forearm + Hand).


<center>![ICUB_ELBOW](img/shoulder/ICUB_Elbow_LEFT_Cable_9-10.png)</center> 

!!! tip "Rules of routing"
    1. Remove the lower part of the upper arm cover if  NOT done yet
        2. Remove the lateral plate (the **ONE** with **NO** sensor) by unmounting the 2 screws holding it.
        3. Turn the main shaft by the help of a screw driver to apply enough torque to make it spin, until you reach the same situation as the pictures above (this is the view from **below** of the elbow)
        4. Replace the broken cable(s) by starting to enter the head crimp   (4mm size – smaller one or ball crimp) of the cable 9 and 10 inside their respective tensioner.
        5. Pass both heads of crimp before reattaching the Lateral Plate.
        6. Position the head of crimp in their socket
        7. start tightening the screws of both tensioner.
