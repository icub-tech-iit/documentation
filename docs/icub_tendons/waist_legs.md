YOU would probably asking me why did we need to remove all of this for?
And the answer is that unfortunately the cover are preventing us for either tense the cables or access to some pieces.

IF YOU HAVE **<u>ONLY</u>**CABLE 13 BROKEN JUST GO DIRECTLY [HERE](#24-waist-top-cable-13)

**C - remove the back pulley**

!!!WATCH OUT
    once the pulley or one side of the cable 13 is removed the rotation of the torso is totally free, someone else help is more than appreciated to hold it firmly the robot in this process.

### 2.2	WAIST BACK - Cable 11

<center>![waist](img\waist\Waist_cable_11.png)</center>
!!! WARNING
    routing cable 11 is quite simple in process of construction because you don't have yet the upper body mounted atop of the waist **<u>BUT</u>** become particularly tedious in phase of repair due to the presence of this latter. If you haven't removed the cover above the torso and the back (or backpack cover), please follow this [link](#21-chest-back-and-back-pack-covers-dismounting)



**How to lock securedly the crimp:**
when you finalize your wiring it is important to realize that the tensioners are actually designed to prevent the crimp from escaping. As most of the cable inside the robot use the property of antagonism cabling it is important to have them both firmly tighten.

!!! Note "Rule"
    The crimp is always **rotated upside down** in order to prevent the crimp cable from popping out. The drawback of this positioning is that you always need to remove both tensioner and the screw to leave the crimp getting in the through and put back the tensioner above it to finalize the wiring.

<center>![waist](./img/waist/crimp_locking.jpg)</center>



**Procedure:**

> Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place the cable onto the slot of the pulley (Photo 1). Put the squared plate above the cable and secure it with 4 screws with hexagonal head size M2.5x5 (Photo 2)



![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto.png)



!!!WARNING
    For people having the upper body still hanging **CLOSE** the gap <center><img src="../img/waist/close-gap.png" width = 500></center>



> Turn the cable around the pulley taking care to cross it at the opposite side of the plate (Photo 3 - 4).

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto3_4.png)</center>


> Each side of the cable go up and pass into the little side pulley (Photo 5 - 6)

!!! Tip
    Use a 2mm hexagonal screwdriver to spin the motor shaft (Photo N.9)  - on both sides of iCub hips - allowing you to rotate the internal pulley (where yield the tensioners) and have it in a proper angle.

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto5_6.png)</center>
> To finish the wiring, position the head of the crimps inside their respective tensioners on both side of the inner part of the hips (Photo 7 - 8). Please use the rule for a proper locking of the crimp [link](#21-chest-back-and-back-pack-covers-dismounting)


<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto7_8.png)</center>
> To bring the joint a proper position to start correctly the routing of cable 12, please use the head screw inside the hips (Photo 9) simultaneously or one hip at a time by few degree every now and then. To arrive on the position (Photo 10)

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto9-10.png)</center>
### 2.3	WAIST FRONT – Cable 12

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_front.PNG)</center>

 **Procedure:**

> Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place the cable into the slot of the pulley (Photo 12)

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto11-12.png)</center>
> Put the rectangular plate above the cable and secure it with 4 screws M2.5x5 hexagonal head (Photo 13). Turn the cable around the pulley taking care to cross the cable above the pulley (Photo 14).

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto13-14.png)</center>
> To finish the wiring, position the head of the crimps inside their respective tensioners on both side of the inner part of the hips (Photo 15 - 16).
> Please use the rule for a proper locking of the crimp [link](#21-chest-back-and-back-pack-covers-dismounting)

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_11_foto15-16.png)</center>
> Finally, To put an end to the wiring of cable 11 and 12, just tense the 4 tensioners on which the crimps are located. Take care of tensing every one of them little by little in order to share the tension inside the tensioners in the same way.

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_cable_foto17.png)</center>
> At this point, the cables of the wiring of the waist 11 and 12 is terminated and therefore it is possible to proceed with the positioning of the upper body above the latter.

### 2.4	WAIST TOP – Cable 13

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_top.PNG)</center>
**Procedure:**

> Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place it in the slot on the piece RC_TLR_001_P_243 (Photo 18).Put the plate RC_USAL_001_P_219 on the cable and secure it with 4 screws M2.5x5 hexagonal head (Photo 19).

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_top18_19.PNG)</center>
> Turn the cable around the RC_TLR_001_P_243 piece taking care to cross it around the pulley, the opposite side to the plate (Photo 20).Then pass the cable through the grooves of the pulleys RC_USAL_001_P_119 (Photo 21) 

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_top20_21.PNG)</center>
> To Finish the wiring, draw the cable along the pulley RC_USAL_001_P_124, and place the crimp in the appropriate tensioner RC_USAL_001_P_131 (Photo 22). Do the same for the other side of the cable and cross the cable before reaching the tensioner (Photo 23).

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Waist_top22_23.PNG)</center>
## 3	LEG CABLING

> This chapter describes the steps required both during construction and in maintenance phase to route of the cables 14 of the hip of the robot and cables 15 or 16 of the ankle present on robot with lower body version 1.


### 3.1	HIP FLEXION – Cable 14

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Wiring-LEG_Cable_14.PNG)</center>
**Preparation:**

> The cable has to be previously peeled off, at a distance of 435 mm from crimp, for a total of 50 mm. (see below)

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Wiring-LEG_Cable_14_built.PNG)</center>
!!! TIP
    the latter version of iCub have a cover, you may need to remove it before proceeding(see picture below). To do that remove the 2 screws of the cover. To unscrew them it is important to see them, use a hexagonal screw driver 2mm and turn the motor shaft from the other side of the motor(see picture below).

    <center>![waist](./img/waist/hip-cover.png)</center>

**Procedure:**

> Take the cable and place the part stripped in the slot on the piece RC_IIT_001_P_314, then center and block it with the help of the plate RC_IIT_001_P_328 (Photo 24). The shortest part of the cable is the one going outside of the robot.

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Wiring-LEG_24_25.PNG)</center>
> Take the inner part of the cable (the right one so to speak – or the longest) and make one turn around the pulley RC_IIT_001_P_314 (Photo 25). If done correctly you should have the 2 crimps reunited down below the hip (photo N.26).
> At this point proceed route the cables by making an 8 shape, by crossing the cables and follow the wiring (photo N.28) (shortest part - yellow cable) and insert both crimp inside their respective tensioner -  piece RC_USAL_001_P_131 (Photo 27).

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Wiring-LEG_26_27_28.PNG)</center>
### 4.1	ANKLE FLEXION - Cable 15 or Cable 16

Those 2 cables are only on some previous iCub design V1.

> Follow the following diagram in order to rewire correctly.

## 5	STAND – FAST ROBOT LOCKER 

> This chapter describes the construction of fast locker to connect the robot to the stand seat

### 5.1	STAND  - Cable 29 

**Procedure:**

> Take the cable and put it so that the crimp goes into the slot of the piece RC_IIT_090_P_009 (Photo 29-30).

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Stand_Cable_29_foto29_30.PNG)</center>
> Attach the hook, or the piece PKWS4SLIDER with two screws 3x5 TSV, to RC_IIT_090_P_009 piece (Photo 31).Place on the part of the cable RC_IIT_090_P_007 piece and then the adjustment mechanism for proper closure piece RC_IIT_090_P_007 (Photo 31-32)

<center>![waist](./img/waist/Stand_Cable_29_foto31_32.PNG)</center>
> At this point, proceed by entering what has been previously mounted into the slot of the support RC_IIT_090_P_005 (Photo 33).Complete the installation by screwing the threaded part of the piece RC_IIT_090_P_006 with the piece  RC_IIT_090_P_008 (Photo 34)
